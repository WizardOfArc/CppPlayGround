Use a Song Blueprint	<div class="details"> <p> A Song Blueprint will act as your map to keep you from getting lost and/or overwhelmed when songwriting and especially when co-writing.  </p> <p> I tend to use a google doc file to do my song blueprinting.  And starting one up is my first step when writing a song - especially lyrics. I like using the Google Doc because it's flexible, nothing feels set in stone - which used to get in the way of me finishing songs - I'd write on paper and be so judgey about it because I didn't realize that I can change things later.  So now I'll put in place holders or throw away items and use that for inspiration and to keep going - then I can easily tweak things later.  </p> <p> How I structure my Song Blueprint: <ol> <li>Put title at top with "what this song is about" in <span class="notice-me">&lt;</span>angle brackets<span class="notice-me">&gt;</span>.</li> <li>Then I put a block for Verse one </li> <li>Then one for verse two</li> <li>Then I put a block for the chorus</li> <li>And then I might put one in for a bridge</li> <li>For each block: <ul> <li>I put what the section is about in <span class="notice-me"> &lt;</span>angle brackets<span class="notice-me"> &gt;</span>.</li> <li>I put words I'm brain storming in <span class="notice-me">&lbrack;</span>square brackets<span class="notice-me">&rbrack;</span>.</li> <li>I put any musial ideas, directions, or inspirations in <span class="notice-me">&lbrace;</span>curly braces<span class="notice-me">&rbrace;</span>.</li> <li>When I know the lyrical/melodic accent pattern I put them in using <span class="notice-me">-</span> for accented syllables and <span class="notice-me">.</span> for unaccented syllables. <br/>For example: &ldquo;I think I've got an idea&rdquo; &rarr; <span class="notice-me">. -.-. .-.</span></li> </ul> </li> </ol> </p> <p>Another advantage to using a google doc is that I can access it from any device: my laptop, my ipad, or my phone - so I can use it whenever I get inspiration and/or time - no excuse to not be able to work on it.</p> </div>
