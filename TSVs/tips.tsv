Use a Song Blueprint	<div class="details"> <p> A Song Blueprint will act as your map to keep you from getting lost and/or overwhelmed when songwriting and especially when co-writing.  </p> <p> I tend to use a google doc file to do my song blueprinting.  And starting one up is my first step when writing a song - especially lyrics. I like using the Google Doc because it's flexible, nothing feels set in stone - which used to get in the way of me finishing songs - I'd write on paper and be so judgey about it because I didn't realize that I can change things later.  So now I'll put in place holders or throw away items and use that for inspiration and to keep going - then I can easily tweak things later.  </p> <p> How I structure my Song Blueprint: <ol> <li>Put title at top with "what this song is about" in <span class="notice-me">&lt;</span>angle brackets<span class="notice-me">&gt;</span>.</li> <li>Then I put a block for Verse one </li> <li>Then one for verse two</li> <li>Then I put a block for the chorus</li> <li>And then I might put one in for a bridge</li> <li>For each block: <ul> <li>I put what the section is about in <span class="notice-me"> &lt;</span>angle brackets<span class="notice-me"> &gt;</span>.</li> <li>I put words I'm brain storming in <span class="notice-me">&lbrack;</span>square brackets<span class="notice-me">&rbrack;</span>.</li> <li>I put any musial ideas, directions, or inspirations in <span class="notice-me">&lbrace;</span>curly braces<span class="notice-me">&rbrace;</span>.</li> <li>When I know the lyrical/melodic accent pattern I put them in using <span class="notice-me">-</span> for accented syllables and <span class="notice-me">.</span> for unaccented syllables. <br/>For example: &ldquo;I think I've got an idea&rdquo; &rarr; <span class="notice-me">. -.-. .-.</span></li> </ul> </li> </ol> </p> <p>Another advantage to using a google doc is that I can access it from any device: my laptop, my ipad, or my phone - so I can use it whenever I get inspiration and/or time - no excuse to not be able to work on it.</p> </div>
Use Chord Tones	<div class="details vscode-body vscode-light"> <h1 id="chord-tones-are-key">Chord Tones Are Key!</h1> <p>If you want to get started playing and creating new riffs and melodies quickly, the best thing to do is to focus first on learning two things:</p> <ol> <li>Notes of the chords</li> <li>Notes on your instrument</li> </ol> <h2 id="playing-the-chord-notes">Playing The Chord Notes</h2> <ul> <li>If you play the notes of the chords your are playing with it will feel just right</li> <li>If you play notes that aren't in the chords it will create different levels of friction (that's okay - play with that - but knowing the chord tones will help you know when and why this happens)</li> <li>Knowing the notes of the chords can help you distribute the notes among your band members to discover creative arrangements</li> </ul> <h2 id="what-about-notes-not-in-the-chords">What about notes not in the chords?</h2> <ul> <li>Don't worry about <strong>&quot;Chord Scales&quot;</strong></li> <li>Play what you want but if you want tips: <ol> <li>use notes from the chord that's coming next for a little bit of foreshadowing</li> <li>If you want to add a little <em>jazzy</em> spice - right before the downbeat of the next bar with a new chord, play the note a semi-tone below the next chord note before you play that chord note on the downbeat</li> <li>Use your ears and sing the notes you play to discover new sounds and melodies</li> </ol> </li> </ul> <h2 id="notes-on-the-instrument">Notes on the instrument</h2> <p>There are two factors or angles to look at:</p> <ol> <li>You don't need to know the note names on your instrument to play chord tones as long as you know where your root is and the relationships/intervals</li> <li>However, you need to know where your root is - so you need to know the names of the notes on the guitar to at least know where to go to play your root.  <ul><li>I'll add another tip for learning your notes for guitarists and bassists</li></ul></li> </ol> <p><em><strong>I use chord tones to &quot;cheat&quot; all the time!</strong></em></p> </div>
